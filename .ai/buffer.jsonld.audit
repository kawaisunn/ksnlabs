    "whatWeWereWorkingOn": "Network reconnaissance for cross-workstation access (BIGSPIDER <-> IGS)",
    "whyItMatters": "User splits time equally between home (BIGSPIDER) and IGS office (igs-antiquarian). Claude Desktop config only covers local filesystem. Extending access through RDP would enable AI-assisted work on IGS resources without being physically present.",
    "whereWeLeftOff": "Engram v2 overhaul COMPLETE + compact encoding prototype COMPLETE. Parallel files written: buffer.compact, consolidated_epoch-002.compact, ENCODING.md spec. Benchmarked: 61-70% byte reduction, est 70-75% token reduction. User approved epoch-003 transition to compact-primary format. NEXT SESSION: declare epoch-003, switch compact to primary, JSON to audit-only. Also still pending: RDP drive redirection for IGS access.",
    "whatComesNext": "1) Configure RDP drive redirection on existing connection. 2) Test \\\\tsclient\\C access from IGS RDP session. 3) Consider adding mapped drive path to claude_desktop_config.json filesystem server. 4) Resume aggdb/OCRITD work from todo queue.",
