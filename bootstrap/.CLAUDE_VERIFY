# Claude Filesystem Verification File
# Deploy to C:\dev\.CLAUDE_VERIFY on each workstation
# Updated: 2026-02-16

# If you can read this via udc:read_file, you have filesystem access.
VERIFICATION=PASSED

# Common mistakes:
# - Testing bash_tool first (reports Linux — misleading)
# - Using wrong tool name "filesystem:list_allowed_directories" (correct: udc:list_allowed_directories)
# - Greeting user before verification completes
