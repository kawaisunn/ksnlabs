  "launchCondition": "cold-start, no boot protocol executed, user manually oriented session",
  "sessionNarrative": "First Opus 4.6 session on BIGSPIDER. Launched without boot protocol — user had to correct my initial claim of being web-only Claude (I tested bash_tool first, got Linux, declared myself containerized). User guided me to discover Windows-MCP and UDC tools, at which point I manually walked the claude_start.json protocol and loaded the full engram. User then requested investigation of RDP connectivity to IGS workstation (igs-antiquarian, 172.28.196.231). Conducted network reconnaissance: confirmed RDP is the ONLY open port from BIGSPIDER to IGS. SMB, SSH, WinRM, and all common ports are blocked by UI Sophos firewall. Tailscale connects both machines (bigspider 100.120.131.75, igs-antiquarian 100.118.38.103) but Sophos on the university network eats the Tailscale executable on IGS, preventing bidirectional Tailscale functionality. Identified three approaches for cross-workstation access: RDP drive redirection (recommended), reverse SSH tunnel, and visual RDP operation. Session stalled during aggressive port-scanning tool chain — too many sequential tool calls consumed resources. User recovered session and redirected to engram contribution.",

The port scan chain was useful intelligence but the cost was nearly the session itself. Be surgical. One probe at a time. Checkpoint after each finding."
